      <title>3D Printing Tensile Testing</title>
      <link>https://melyndaschreiber.github.io/projects/tensile_tests/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fused Deposit Modeling, or 3D printing has revolutionized the way ideas move from concept to reality. The goal of this work was to determine if the 3D printing factors such as solid layers, wall thickness, fill density and print material have a significant effect on the strength properties of a 3D part. A factorial analysis shows that the number of layers used to make a part as well as the thickness of the walls of a part play a significant role in the parts tensile strength. Additionally, predictive models were developed for the maximum load a 3d printed part could withstand before yielding and the modulus of the part, depending on the material composition of the part and several other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Thumb to Hold</title>
      <link>https://melyndaschreiber.github.io/volunteering/thumb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Thomas, I created a 3D Printed thumb to help a woman
perform activities of daily living. The material was printed with high strength,
high heat resistance so that it could withstand heat coming from the oven and
other sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Insole for the Soul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Jan Black, I created a 3D Printed heel lift to help
stabilize the ankle of Kendal Levine, an LDS missionary hit by a car overseas.
She wanted to wear her church shoes again and asked if could help. I designed
and printed a soft custom heel lift which was able to inserted into shoes. These
shoes were the first shoes with stability that she had worn without her braces.
Click on the link to her stand for the first time unassisted since her accident.
You can see me sitting down in the background at 3:30.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons From A Neck Brace</title>
      <link>https://melyndaschreiber.github.io/volunteering/neck_brace/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Dr.Andrew Merryweather, I created a 3D Printed neck brace
to prevent a child from breaking their neck. We scanned the child&amp;rsquo;s neck with a
3D scanner. The data was imported into a Meshmixer to create a digital human. An
exoskeleton of the subhect was created to form a brace for the neck.The project was not successful, but
it pointed out major problems that healthcare will need to overcome to advance
prosthetics and orthotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measure Vibration Risk</title>
      <link>https://melyndaschreiber.github.io/projects/vibration/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrote a labview script to collect accelerometer data with the Hand Arm Vibration
Meter (HVM1000). I then quantified the exposure time limits for 4, 6 and 8 hours.
I used weighting and transfer functions to calculate the maximum transient
vibration value (MTVV) adn the power vibration dose value (VDV).&lt;/p&gt;
